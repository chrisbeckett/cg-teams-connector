# CloudGuard Microsoft Teams Connector

## What does it do?

This connector runs as an Azure Function and provides a webhook URL for CloudGuard (formerly Dome9) to send alerts to. This provides simple connectivity to Microsoft Teams as it sends alert information as cards into a Teams channel.

## What do I need to get started?

* A CloudGuard tenant (duh)
* An onboarded cloud account or two
* Continuous Compliance configured
* A Microsoft Teams account (double duh)
* A teams channel to send alerts to
* Python 3.7
* Git
